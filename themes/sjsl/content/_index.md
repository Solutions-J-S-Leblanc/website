Hi, I'm Joel Leblanc.

As an engineer, I help companies build and deliver high quality software by eliminating obstacles in the development process.

For just under a decade, I have had the opportunity to work on exciting projects in various industries, including finance, defense, automotive, and more.

I collaborate with teams to break down large projects into small increments that bring value early to gain valuable feedback. I help put the right tools and practices in place to facilitate continuous integration and streamline the development process through automation to let developers focus on doing their best work.
